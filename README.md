Original Instructions from mod author:
1. Identify a font you want to use and look at what number it is on the list above e.g. Runic is number 4 remember this , Visit this website which its name is in the last slide of the slideshow and place the name in the first box with spaces between the letters. E.g. “A b c d”
2. you will want to add (1000 * the number you noted) to each grouping at the bottom box. e.g. in this case it is 4 so we will add 4000 to each grouping, 00065 00098 00099 00100 becomes 04065 04098 04099 04100
3. Remove the spaces between the groupings, e.g. 04065 04098 04099 04100 will become 04065040980409904100 . If your desired name needs spaces then you can add them back in step 4
4. We now notice that the first box contains weird looking characters copy these, go in to rename a title and paste those weird looking characters into the box. Hopefully now the title will be the desired name and in the desired font. When pasting it should now look normal and you can add spaces where needed. Also note that Runic is a font that only has capital letters so that is why all letters are in the same case.


My script will first prompt you to select the font from a list. You will imput a corresponding number to select the font. Then the script will prompt you for the title you are trying to 'font-ize'. Enter the title and press enter, then there will likely be a line of squares printed after. That line is your title. Copy that and paste it into CK3 when you're renaming your title. If you're running the Dynamic Cultural Fonts mod, you will have the font you selected used for your title.
